PyJobShop and Temporal Networks

# Available code
## PyJobShopIntegration
This folder provides a startpoint for this research project, as it shows some initial steps towards converting the original 
AAAI code to generalized code that can be integrated with PyJobShop. Note that the other folders in this repo origin from
the original AAAI github repository, for which the READ.me is located in the root folder.

### example_aaai_paper.py
This script implements the example from the appendix of the AAAI paper.

### example_fjsp.py
This script uses a PyJobShop example for the FJSP, and converts it's solution into a STNU and runs the DC-checking algorithm.

### example_rcpsp_max.py
This script uses the uses an instance from RCPSP/max and our code, but now uses a PyJobShop model to solve the deterministic problem and to construct the STNU.

### utils.py
This script contains a piece of code from Joost Berkhout which is close to what we have developed for get_resource_chains. I also copied our get_resource_chains there, because I expect that we will make adjustments to it.

# Proposed problems per student:
1. Flexible-job shop problem with no-wait constraints and maximal time-lags
2. Flexible-job shop problem with sequence dependent set-up times
3. Flexible-job shop problem with (hard) deadlines
4. Multi-mode RCPSP (optional with deadlines deadlines)
5. Multi-mode RCPSP/max (with generalized time-lags/no-wait constraints)

Other variants like permutation flowshop, hybrid flowshop (with deadlines and no-wait constraints or max time-lags, or sequence-dependent set-up times) can also be discussed/

* It is expected that the instances need to be adjusted for the stochastic setting.
